This is a high altitude balloon project for the Linn-Benton Community College's Space Exploration Club.

This README is a work in progress.

Our High Altitude Balloon project this summer has been focused on the tracking and physical components of a more complicated launch.

Our goal was to create a modular cutdown system capable of releasing our payload at a specific time during launch.  We're using a parachute to bring the payload down at a safe speed, and testing various methods of rigging to prevent tangles both in flight and while falling.

This documentation should be updated with pictures after our launch, we're still making changes quickly.
